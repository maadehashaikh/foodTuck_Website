API INTEGRATION REPORT [FOODTUCK]

API integration process ?
In this project, the API integration will done using Next.js along with the Sanity CMS. The createClient function from the next-sanity library will used 
to establish a connection with the Sanity project by providing the project ID, dataset, and API version. An asynchronous function will defined 
inside the useEffect hook to fetch data from the Sanity CMS, specifically retrieving a list of products , chefs that are marked as available and excluding 
certain chefs. The data fetched will includes details like the chef's name, position, and image URL and food's name, image, price, a small description and 
availibility true or false .Once the data is retrieved, it is stored in the state using usestate and a loading state is used to show a loading message 
until the data is fully fetched. The fetched data is then displayed dynamically in the UI using React components.

Adjustments made to schemas ? 
Yes as I have got ready made schemas of food and chefs then it will be more easy to just craete the order's detail schema and I will work on it as checkout
will take all the user's info and then store it to schema of orders
